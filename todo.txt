POC

load optimisation to reduce total storage, by deleting and not downloading highly redundant files in collec
	get stats from all other beacons how many torrents they have downloaded
	target 


3 peer 100%



3 40%

Future Scopes

longest alive beacon



long term plan - not implemented for POC
longest active beacons are most stable beacons
ideally the beacons store critical/rare/small files
while newly active beacons will handle more of the bandwidth load



___________________________________________________________________________
Already done

finding beacons


how beacons find each other?
1. all seeds and peers of beacon.torrent are considered as beacons
2. collection file contains beacon's addresses
3. ask known beacons for more beacons


keep-alive 5 minutes

how beacons connect?
udp

how data is stored
1. no database is required
2. collection file

Swarm
Swarm is to get a situational overview, search for objects, monitor the environment, or establish a communication network. Coordinated motion moves the swarm of robots in a formation. The formation can have a well-defined shape, e.g., a line, or be arbitrary as in flocking.
swarm intelligence in natural systems include ant colonies, bee colonies, bird flocking, hawks hunting, animal herding, bacterial growth, fish schooling and microbial intelligence.
A Swarm is a configuration of tens of thousands of individuals that have chosen their own will to converge on a common goal. Swarm Intelligence is the Complex Collective, Self-Organized, Coordinated, Flexible and Robust Behaviour of a group following the simple rules.
Advantages:
1) Flexible: The colony respond to internal disturbances and external challenges.
2) Robust: Tasks are completed even if some agents fail.
3) Scalable: From a few agents to millions
4) Decentralized: There is no central control in the colony.
5) Self-organized: The solutions are emergent rather than pre-defined.
6) Adaptation: The swarm system can not only adjust to predetermined stimuli but also to new stimuli.
7) Speed: Changes in the network can be propagated very fast.
8) Modularity: Agents act independently of other network layers.
9) Parallelism: Agents' operations are inherently parallel.
