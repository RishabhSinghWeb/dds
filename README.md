# Controlled Redundancy P2P Distributed Data Storage
The efficient and optimized distribution of files in peer-to-peer networks is a critical aspect of torrenting protocols.
This novel solution builds on top of existing torrenting protocols to track the redundancy rate of files in a network and optimize file downloads. This network leverages redundancy tracking to instruct nodes to download files that are below a redundancy target, thereby reducing unnecessary duplication of files and optimizing bandwidth usage.

Additionally, this solution provides information to nodes about heavily seeded files, allowing them to reclaim disk space by deleting redundant files. We present a comprehensive system architecture and implementation details of our proposed solution, along with an evaluation of its performance through experiments or simulations. This improves the efficiency of file distribution in torrenting networks and has the potential to significantly reduce bandwidth usage and storage requirements. The findings contribute to the field of P2P networks and offer insights for further research and development in optimizing torrenting protocols.
